# Thesis

Until officially published, the document is publicly available via
[my Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OLN0WzLUbm8XvmKhO_ugdeV8x1xFX8yP).

Running `make thesis` will generate, in a folder called `pdfs/`, an overall pdf of the entire thesis
and pdfs for each chapter.

To include the figures, you'll need the separate repo
[thesis-figs](https://github.com/charlesfrye/thesis-figs)
cloned into a directory at the same height.
