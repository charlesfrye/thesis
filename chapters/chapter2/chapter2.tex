\section{Chapter Summary}\sectionlabel{summary}

In this chapter,
we define multiple algorithms for finding critical points:
gradient norm minimization
and a wide variety of Newton methods
(\sectionref{algo}).
Then, in \sectionref{verify},
we demonstrate the behavior of these algorithms
on several simple neural networks.
First, as a warm up,
we cover multiple linear and logistic regression
(\sectionref{linear}).
Then, we apply these algorithms to a more realistic,
but still linear and so tractable network:
a deep linear auto-encoder.
This example, which is
a generalization of \exampleref{1ddlae},
is a form of principal components analysis.
It is used to draw lessons useful
for finding the critical points of non-linear networks,
the subject of \chapterref{three}.

\section{Algorithms for Finding Critical Points}\sectionlabel{algo}

Importantly, we restrict ourselves to numerical approaches.
While the analytical critical points exactly satisfy
the analytical system of (possibly non-linear) equations
\begin{equation}
	\grad{L}{\theta} = 0
\end{equation}
\noindent numerical approaches cannot guarantee
exact equality.
Instead, they can at best guarantee \emph{approximate} equality,
\begin{equation}
	\sgn{L}{\theta} \leq \eps
\end{equation}
\noindent for some $\eps > 0$.
So our algorithms will actually recover approximate critical points:

\begin{definition}{$\eps$-Critical Points}{epscritical}
	The set of all \emph{$\eps$-critical points} of a loss function $L$
	on a domain $\Theta$ for a fixed $\eps\geq0$ is denoted $\Theta^L_{\ecp}$
	and defined as
	\begin{equation}\equationlabel{def-epscp}
		\Theta^L_{\ecp} \defeq
		\Set{\theta \in \Theta \suchthat \sgn{L}{\theta} \leq \eps}
	\end{equation}
	When unambiguous, the super-script $L$ will be omitted.
	See \defref{critical}.
\end{definition}

If only introduced in the case of large-dimensional $\Theta$
and complex loss function $L$,
this definition and the problem setup can be somewhat intimidating.
\sectionref{sqrt} demonstrates a precise analogy
between finding critical points of complicated loss functions
and a fundamental arithmetic operation: taking the square root.

The lessons of this analogy are used to motivate
each of three algorithms in turn:
gradient norm minimization (\sectionref{gnm}),
exact Newton methods (\sectionref{exact}),
and inexact Newton methods (\sectionref{inexact}).
Practical versions of Newton methods
for high-dimensional problems
require additional tricks,
which are reviewed in \sectionref{practical}.

\subsection{Optimization Approach to Taking Square Roots}\sectionlabel{sqrt}

Addition ($+$) and multiplication ($\times$)
are simple operations, in the following sense:
given exact binary representations for two numbers,
an exact binary representation for the result of $+$ or $\times$
applied to those two numbers can be obtained in finite time\footnote{%
Specifically, addition is $O(n)$ and
multiplication is $O(n\log n)$~\cite{harvey2019},
courtesy of the Fast Fourier Transform and the convolution theorem.}.
The symbols $a + b$ and $a \times b$ represent the exact, finite output
of a concrete, finite-time algorithm.
That is, both operations define closed monoids over
binary strings of
(importantly!) finite-length.

This is not true of division ($\div$), inverse ($\inv{}$), or square root%
\footnote{We take the type signature of $\sqrt$ to be
$\sqrt{}\from\R_{\geq 0}\to\R_{\geq 0}$,
i.e.~we do not allow non-real or negative square roots.}
($\sqrt{}$).
In these cases, the operation is actually defined in terms of a promise regarding what happens
when the output of this operation is subjected to $\times$:
\begin{align}
    b = a \div c &\implies b \times c = a\equationlabel{div-promise}\\
    b = a^{-1} &\implies b \times a = 1\equationlabel{inv-promise} \\
    b = \sqrt{a} &\implies b \times b = a\equationlabel{sqrt-promise}
\end{align}
\noindent and for an exact representation of a number $a$,
the number that fulfills this promise might not have an exact representation,
as is famously the case for $\sqrt{2}$.
This makes algorithm design for these operations more complex than for $+$ and $\times$.

There are individual strategies for each,
but one general idea that turns out to be very powerful is
\emph{relaxation to an optimization problem}.
That is, we take the exact promises made above,
recognize them as statements of the optimality of the output for some criterion,
and then use that criterion to define an approximate promise,
true up to some tolerance $\eps$.

For $\sqrt{}$, we rearrange the promise~\ref{eq:sqrt-promise},
denoting its exact solution with a $\star$, into:
\begin{align}
    b^\star &\defeq \sqrt{a} \\
    b^\star \times b^\star &= a  \\
    b^\star \times b^\star - a &= 0  \\
    \snorm{b^\star \times b^\star - a} &=0\equationlabel{sqrt-opt-criter}
\end{align}

\noindent and then recognize that, due to the non-negativity of the norm,
\equationref{sqrt-opt-criter} is a statement of optimality about $b^\star$.
That is,
the value $b^\star$ that we are looking for is the
argument that minimizes the expression on the LHS:\@
\begin{equation}
	b^\star = \argmin_{b \in \R_{\geq 0}} \snorm{b \times b - a}
\end{equation}

Exactly minimizing this expression to arbitrary precision
might be impossible,
so we instead consider a set of approximate square roots,
to a tolerance $\eps$:
\begin{equation}
	B_\eps \defeq
	\Set{b \in \R_{\geq 0} \suchthat \snorm{b^\star \times b^\star - a} \leq \eps }
\end{equation}
\noindent and so the problem of square root finding
is the problem of finding a member of $B_\eps$.

Analogously, the problem of critical point-finding
is the problem of \emph{gradient root finding}:
instead of trying to find a value $b$ such that
$b\times b - a$
is approximately $0$,
we are trying to find a value $\theta$ such that
$\grad{L}{\theta}$
is approximately $0$.
This $\theta$ is a member of $\Theta^L_{\ecp}$,
\defref{epscritical}.
